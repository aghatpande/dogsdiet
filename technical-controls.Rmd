```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

There are multiple samples (sequencing libraries) representing different types of technical controls, viz, water, DNA extraction, mock etc. The descriptions are found in the "SampleName" column of the original 'runinfo.csv" and its derivative variables 

```{r, filtering runinfo for techcontrols}
techcntrlsRuninfo <- filtered_runinfo %>% filter (grepl("DNA_extract|Mock|Water", SampleName))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
